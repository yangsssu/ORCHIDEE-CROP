The files in this folder are the required files when you run with the .sh files in Config. Each after each year, you need to collect the harvesting date and yield from ORCHIDEE, use ML to correct the results, then you need to change the harvesting date inside the csv file, and use the .m programme to generate the run.def and config card for ORCHIDEE. The model will re-run the ORCHIDEE to the date of the corrected harvesting day, and then change the crop, and continue the calculation for the next crop
