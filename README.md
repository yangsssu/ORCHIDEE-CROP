# ORCHIDEE-CROP
This is the ORCHIDEE-CROP model used in the paper "Global warming increases the chance of success of maize-wheat double cropping in Europe"

The model is written in Fortran, and to use this model, you first need to install the necessary environment, please follow the tutorial on this website, https://forge.ipsl.jussieu.fr/orchidee/wiki/Documentation/UserGuide .

Our model is running on Obelix server at LSCE, you can check the set up environment at: â€‹http://forge.ipsl.jussieu.fr/igcmg_doc/wiki/Doc/ComputingCenters/LSCE, the input files can be found in R_IN=/home/orchideeshare/igcmg/IGCM.

After you install the necessary environment, you need to go to the util folder, run ins_make to install the make files, and then go to Config/ORCHIDEE_OL/ to use make_without_xios to compile the model.

The folders inside Config/ORCHIDEE_OL/ are the cases simulated, including Maize/wheat monocropping, maize/wheat double cropping, single cropping with maize/wheat in rotation.
