\begin{equation}
LM_{min}(i) = \frac{LAI_{init,min}(j)}{SLA(j)} 
\end{equation}
where $LM_{min}$ is the minimum leaf biomass, $LAI_{init\_min}$ is the minimum initial LAI, which is
PFT-dependent and specified by the parameter ::pheno_crit\%lai\_initmin, which is defined in 
::stomate\_constants. SLA, the specific leaf area, is also PFT-dependent and defined in
::stomate\_constants. i and j are the grid cell number and PFT respectively.
