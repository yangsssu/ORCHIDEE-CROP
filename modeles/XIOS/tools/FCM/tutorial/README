This directory contains the files necessary to set up a Subversion repository
for the FCM tutorial.

The "svn.dump" file should be loaded into an empty Subversion repository using
the "svnadmin load" command.

The hook scripts in "hooks/" should then be installed in this repository in
order to prevent any commits to the trunk. Note that the configuration file
"svnperms.conf" assumes that the tutorial repository is called "tutorial_svn".
Please edit this file if you use a different name.

For example (in bash/ksh):

(shell)$ cd fcm-release/tutorial/ # to this directory
(shell)$ path_to_tutorial_repos=/path/to/repos/tutorial_svn
(shell)$ svnadmin create $path_to_tutorial_repos
(shell)$ svnadmin load $path_to_tutorial_repos <svn.dump
(shell)$ cp hooks/* $path_to_repos/tutorial_svn/hooks/

The repository should be configured to allow users write access. You may find
it easiest to simply allow anonymous access.

A Trac environment should be configured to be associated with the tutorial
repository. You then need to allow users write access. You may find it easiest
to set up a number of guest accounts for this purpose.
