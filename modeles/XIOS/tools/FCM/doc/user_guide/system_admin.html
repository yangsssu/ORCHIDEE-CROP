  <h1>System Administration</h1>

  <div id="fcm-content"></div>

  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <p>This chapter provides an administration guide for managers of projects or
  systems which are using FCM.</p>

  <p>Note that, where this section refers to the <em>FCM team</em> this applies
  only to Met Office users. External users will either need to refer to the
  equivalent team within their organisation or will need to perfom these tasks
  themselves.</p>

  <h2 id="svn">Subversion</h2>

  <h3 id="svn_design">Repository design</h3>

  <p>The FCM system assumes that each project directory has sub-directories
  called <em>trunk</em>, <em>branches</em> and <em>tags</em> (Subversion
  recommends it but doesn't insist on it). We recommend that each project
  within a Subversion repository is in a sub-directory of the repository
  root.</p>
  <pre>
&lt;root&gt;
    |
    |-- &lt;project 1&gt;
    |       |
    |       |-- trunk
    |       |-- branches
    |       |-- tags
    |
    |-- &lt;project 2&gt;
    |       |
    |       |-- trunk
    |       |-- branches
    |       |-- tags
    |
    |-- ...
</pre>

  <p>In theory you could also have the project as the root directory or several
  levels below the root directory. However, this is not tested and could cause
  problems with some <code>fcm</code> commands so is best avoided.</p>

  <p>You will need to decide whether to use a single project tree for your
  system or whether to use multiple projects.</p>

  <p>Advantages of a single project tree:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Changes to any part of the system can always be committed as a single
    logical changeset. If you split your system into multiple projects then you
    may have occasions when a logical change involves more than one project and
    hence requires multiple commits (and branches).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Disadvantages of a single project tree:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If you have a large system then your working copies may become very
    large and unwieldy. Basic commands such as <code>checkout</code> and
    <code>status</code> can become frustratingly slow if your working copy is
    too large.</li>

    <li>Depending on how you work, you may end up doing lots more merges of
    files that are unrelated to your work.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>One common approach is to split the admin type files (things that only the
  system manager should need to touch) into a separate project from the core
  system files (which all the developers need access to). If you include any
  large data files under version control you may also want to use a separate
  project for them to avoid making your working copies very large when editing
  code.</p>

  <p>Note that there is often no obvious right or wrong answer so you just have
  to make a decision and see how it works out. You can always re-arrange your
  repository in the future (although be aware that this will break any changes
  being prepared on branches at the time).</p>

  <p>You also need to decide whether your system requires its own repository
  (or multiple repositories) or whether it can share with another system.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The main disadvantage of having separate repositories for each system
    is the maintenance overhead (although this is almost all automated by the
    FCM team so is not a big deal).</li>

    <li>We normally configure a single Trac system per repository. If the
    repository contains multiple systems then it makes it difficult to use the
    Trac milestones to handle system releases. However, Trac now supports
    restricting itself to a sub-directory within a repository so, again, this
    is not a big deal.</li>

    <li>If you share a repository with other systems then your revision numbers
    can increase even when there are no changes to your system. This doesn't
    matter but some people don't like it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For simplicity, in most cases you will probably want your own repository
  for your system.</p>

  <p>You will not normally want to have multiple repositories for a system. One
  exception may be if you are storing large data files where you might not want
  to keep all the old versions for ever. Removing old versions can't be done
  without changing all the revision numbers which would mess up all your code
  history and Trac tickets. Storing the large data files in a separate
  repository reduces the impact if you do decide to remove old versions in the
  future. One disadvantage of this approach is that, for the moment at least,
  Trac only handles one repository so you will need a separate Trac system for
  the data files.</p>

  <p>For further details please see the section <a href=
  "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.reposadmin.planning.html#svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout">
  Planning Your Repository Organization</a> from the Subversion book.</p>

  <h3 id="svn_create">Creating a repository</h3>

  <p>Normally the FCM team will help you to set up your initial repository.
  However, it is quite simple if you need to do it yourself. First you need to
  issue the command <code>svnadmin create /path/to/repos</code>. This creates
  an empty repository which is now ready to accept an initial import. To do so,
  you should create a directory tree in a suitable location, and issue the
  <code>svn import</code> command. At the top level of your directory tree
  should be the project directories. Each project should then contain three
  directories <samp>trunk</samp>, <samp>branches</samp> and <samp>tags</samp>.
  The directories <samp>branches</samp> and <samp>tags</samp> should be empty.
  The directory <samp>trunk</samp> should contain your source files in a
  directory structure you have chosen. For example, if your directory tree is
  located at <samp>$HOME/foo</samp>, you will do the following to import it to
  a new repository:</p>
  <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ svnadmin create FOO_svn
(SHELL PROMPT)$ svn import $HOME/foo file://$PWD/FOO_svn -m 'Initial import'
Adding         FOO
Adding         FOO/trunk
Adding         FOO/trunk/doc
Adding         FOO/trunk/doc/hello.html
Adding         FOO/trunk/doc/world.html
Adding         FOO/trunk/src
Adding         FOO/trunk/src/bar
Adding         FOO/trunk/src/bar/egg.f90
Adding         FOO/trunk/src/bar/ham.f90
Adding         FOO/branches
Adding         FOO/tags

Committed revision 1.
</pre>

  <p>Note that the <code>svnadmin</code> command takes a <var>PATH</var> as an
  argument, as opposed to a URL for the <code>svn</code> command.</p>

  <p>For further details please see the section <a href=
  "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.reposadmin.planning.html#svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout">
  Planning Your Repository Organization</a> from the Subversion book.</p>

  <h3 id="svn_access">Access control</h3>

  <p>You will not normally want to allow anonymous write access to your
  repository since this means that changes do not get identified with a userid.
  Therefore system managers need to provide the FCM team with a list of users
  who should have write access to their repositories. You may also want to
  arrange passwords for these users although this is only necessary if you need
  to prevent malicious access. Further restrictions such as preventing
  anonymous read access or restricting write access to the trunk to a limited
  set of users can be arranged if necessary.</p>

  <h3 id="svn_hosting">Repository hosting</h3>

  <p>The FCM team will organise the hosting of your repository. A number of
  facilities will be set up for you as standard.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Your repository will be set up on a central FCM server and access will
    be provided via <code>svnserve</code> (which we use in preference to
    <cite>Apache</cite> for performance reasons). The FCM team will advise you
    of the URL.</li>

    <li>Each night a full backup of your repository will be taken. An integrity
    check will also be performed using the <code>svnadmin verify</code>
    command.</li>

    <li>Standard hook scripts will be set up to handle the following
    post-commit tasks:

      <ul>
        <li>Each time a changeset is successfully committed an incremental dump
        of the new revision is taken. This would allow the repository to be
        recovered should the live repository become corrupted for whatever
        reason.</li>

        <li>A file is updated which records the latest revision of your
        repository. This can be used by system managers to regularly check for
        new commits in a cron job and perform any required actions (updating
        files on a remote platform for instance). The FCM team can advise you
        of the location of this file and show you some example scripts which
        make use of it.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Standard hook scripts will be set up to handle the following tasks for
    changes in revision properties (pre-revprop-change/post-revprop-change):

      <ul>
        <li>If a user attempts to modify the log message of a changeset and
        he/she is not the original author of the changeset, the
        pre-revprop-change hook script will e-mail the original author. You can
        also set up a watch facility to monitor changes of log messages that
        affect particular paths in the repository. (See the <a href=
        "#svn_watch">next sub-section</a> for details.)</li>

        <li>The post-revprop-change hook script updates the Trac SQLite
        database following a successful change in the log message.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Additional hook scripts can be put in place if you have a requirement. The
  use of hook scripts is discussed in the section <a href=
  "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.reposadmin.create.html#svn.reposadmin.create.hooks">
  Repository Creation and Configuration</a> from the Subversion book.</p>

  <p>Note that if you want to use a Subversion repository for your own
  individual use there is no need to get the FCM team to host it. You can
  simply create your repository and then use a <code>file://</code> URL to
  access it.</p>

  <h3 id="svn_watch">Watching changes in log messages</h3>

  <p>You can set up a watch facility to monitor changes in revision log
  messages in your repository. An obvious use of this facility is for system
  managers to monitor changes of log messages affecting the trunks of their
  projects. To set up the facility, you will need to add a
  <samp>watch.cfg</samp> file to the root of your repository. (To avoid
  checking out the whole repository, including every branch, make sure that you
  checkout the root of your repository non-recursively, i.e. <code>fcm checkout
  -N URL</code>.) The <samp>watch.cfg</samp> file is an INI-type file, with the
  basic format:</p>
  <pre>
[repos_base]

path/in/repos = list,of,watchers
</pre>

  <p>For example, if your repository is <samp>svn://fcm1/FCM_svn/</samp>, and
  you want set up particular users to monitor changes of the log messages
  affecting several areas within the repository, you may have something like
  this:</p>
  <pre>
[FCM_svn]

FCM/trunk/src            = fred,bob
FCM/trunk/doc            = fred,bob,alice
FCM/branches/dev/*/*/src = fred
</pre>

  <p>Later on, if <samp>dave</samp> attempts to modify the log message of a
  changeset that affects the path <samp>FCM/trunk/src</samp>, <samp>fred</samp>
  and <samp>bob</samp> will both be notified by e-mail.</p>

  <h2 id="trac">Trac</h2>

  <h3 id="trac_config">Trac configuration</h3>

  <p>Normally the FCM team will set up your Trac system for you (using a script
  which helps automate the configuration). This section describes some things
  you may wish to be configured. This can be done when the Trac system is set
  up or later if you are unsure what you will require at first.</p>

  <h4 id="trac_access">Access control</h4>

  <p>You will not normally want to allow anonymous users to make changes to
  your Trac system since this means that changes may not get identified with a
  userid. The FCM team will normally set up your Trac system such that any
  authenticated users can make changes. Further restrictions such as
  restricting write access to named accounts or preventing anonymous read
  access can be arranged if necessary.</p>

  <p>The system manager will normally be given <var>TRAC_ADMIN</var>
  privileges. This allows them to do additional things which normal users
  cannot do such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Delete wiki pages (the latest version or the entire page).</li>

    <li>Add or modify milestones, components and versions.</li>

    <li>Modify ticket descriptions and delete ticket attachments.</li>

    <li>Make wiki pages read-only.</li>

    <li>Alter the permissions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For further details please see the section <a href=
  "http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracPermissions">Trac Permissions</a> from the
  Trac documentation.</p>

  <h4 id="trac_email">Email notification</h4>

  <p>By default, each Trac system is configured such that the owner and
  reporter and anyone on the <var>CC</var> list are notified whenever a change
  is made to a ticket. If system mangers wish to be notified of all ticket
  changes then this can also be configured. Alternatively, email notifications
  can be disabled if they are not wanted.</p>

  <h4 id="trac_milestones">Milestones</h4>

  <p>Milestones are useful for identifying when tickets need to be resolved.
  Typically, milestones may be particular system releases or time periods. The
  FCM team can configure milestones for you when they set up your Trac system.
  However, this is not strictly necessary since milestones can be set up via
  the web interface using the admin account (go to the <q title=
  "http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracRoadmap">Roadmap</q> page).</p>

  <h4 id="trac_misc">Other configurable items</h4>

  <p>There are lots of other things that can be configured in your Trac system
  such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Custom fields</li>

    <li>System icon</li>

    <li>Stylesheets</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For further details please see the sections <a href=
  "http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracIni">The Trac Configuration File</a> and
  <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracTickets">The Trac Ticket
  System</a> from the Trac documentation.</p>

  <h3 id="trac_hosting">Trac hosting</h3>

  <p>The FCM team will organise the hosting of your Trac system. It will be set
  up on the same server that hosts your Subversion repository and access will
  be provided via a web server. The FCM team will advise you of the URL. Each
  night a backup of your Trac system will be taken in case the live system
  should become corrupted for whatever reason.</p>

  <h2 id="fcm-keywords">FCM keywords</h2>

  <p>When you set up a repository for a new project, you will normally want the
  FCM team to set up a URL keyword for it in the FCM central configuration
  file. The name of the project should be a short string containing only word
  characters.</p>

  <p>Individual projects can store revision keywords using the Subversion
  property <code>fcm:revision</code> at registered URLs. Using the UM as an
  example: if <samp>UM</samp> is a registered URL keyword, you can add the
  <code>fcm:revision</code> property at the head of the UM project by doing a
  non-recursive checkout. E.g.:</p>
  <pre>
(prompt)$ fcm co -q -N fcm:um um
(prompt)$ fcm pe fcm:revision um
</pre>

  <p>In the editor, add the following and <code>fcm commit</code>:</p>
  <pre>
VN6.3 = 402
VN6.4 = 1396
VN6.5 = 2599
VN6.6 = 4913
VN7.0 = 6163
</pre>

  <p>In a subsequent invocation of <code>fcm</code>, if a revision keyword is
  specified for a URL in the UM namespace, the command will attempt to load it
  from the <code>fcm:revision</code> property at the head of the UM project.
  Revision keywords can also be defined in the FCM central configuration file
  if you prefer.</p>

  <p>If the project has an associated Trac browser, you can also declare
  browser URL mapping in the central configuration file. This allows FCM to
  associate the Subversion URL with a Trac browser URL. There is an automatic
  default for mapping URLs hosted by the FCM team at the Met Office. External
  users of FCM may want to adjust this default for their site.</p>

  <p>To change the default browser URL mapping, you need to make 3
  <code>SET::URL_BROWSER_MAPPING_DEFAULT::&lt;key&gt;</code> declarations in
  your <samp>$FCM/etc/fcm.cfg</samp> file. There are 3 keys to this
  declaration: <var>LOCATION_COMPONENT_PATTERN</var>,
  <var>BROWSER_URL_TEMPLATE</var> and <var>BROWSER_REV_TEMPLATE</var>. The
  <var>LOCATION_COMPONENT_PATTERN</var> is a Perl regular expression, which is
  used to separate the scheme-specific part of a version control system URL
  into a number of components by capturing its substrings. These components are
  then used to fill in the numbered fields in the
  <var>BROWSER_URL_TEMPLATE</var>. The template should have one more field than
  the number of components captured by <var>LOCATION_COMPONENT_PATTERN</var>.
  The last field is used to place the revision, which is generated via the
  <var>BROWSER_REV_TEMPLATE</var>. This template should have a single numbered
  field for filling in the revision number. This is best demonstrated by an
  example. Consider the declarations:</p>
  <pre>
%pattern       ^//([^/]+)/(.*)$
%url_template  http://{1}/intertrac/source:{2}{3}
%rev_template  @{1}
set::url_browser_mapping_default::location_component_pattern  %pattern
set::url_browser_mapping_default::browser_url_template        %url_template
set::url_browser_mapping_default::browser_rev_template        %rev_template
</pre>

  <p>If we have a Subversion URL <samp>svn://repos/path/to/a/file</samp>, the
  <var>LOCATION_COMPONENT_PATTERN</var> will capture the components
  [<samp>repos</samp>, <samp>path/to/a/file</samp>]. When this is applied to
  the <code>BROWSER_URL_TEMPLATE</code>, <var>{1}</var> will be translated to
  <samp>repos</samp> and <var>{2}</var> will be translated to
  <samp>path/to/a/file</samp>. A revision is not given in this case, and so
  <var>{3}</var> is inserted with an empty string. The result is
  <samp>http://repos/intertrac/path/to/a/file</samp>. If the revision is
  <samp>1357</samp>, the <var>BROWSER_REV_TEMPLATE</var> will be used to
  translate it to <samp>@1357</samp>, which is then inserted to <var>{3}</var>
  of the <var>BROWSER_URL_TEMPLATE</var>. The result is therefore
  <samp>http://repos/intertrac/path/to/a/file@1357</samp>.</p>

  <p>For more information on how to set up the keywords, please refer to
  <a href="code_management.html#svn_basic_keywords">Repository &amp; Revision
  Keywords</a> and the <a href="annex_fcm_cfg.html">Annex: Declarations in FCM
  central/user configuration file</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="ext-bld-cfg">Extract and build configuration</h2>

  <p>The extract and build systems are very flexibile and can be used in lots
  of different ways. It is therefore difficult to give specific advice
  explaining how to configure them. However, based on experience with a number
  of systems, the following general advice can be offered.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Standard extract configuration files should be defined and stored
    within the repository. Users then include these files into their
    configurations, before applying their local changes.</li>

    <li>The files should be designed to include one another in a hierarchy. For
    example, you may have one core file which defines all the repository and
    source locations plus a series of platform/compiler specific files which
    include the core file. More complex setups are also possible if you need to
    cater for other options such as different optimisation levels, 32/64 bit,
    etc.</li>

    <li>When including other configuration files, always make use of the
    special <var>$HERE</var> variable (rather than, for instance, referring to
    a fixed repository location). When your configuration file is parsed, this
    special variable is normally expanded into the container directory of the
    current configuration file. This means that the include statements should
    work correctly whether you are referring to configuration files in the
    repository trunk, in a branch or in a local working copy.</li>

    <li>Make good use of user variables (e.g. <samp>%fred</samp>) to simplify
    repetitive declarations and make your configuration files easier to
    maintain.</li>

    <li>Use continuation lines to split long lines and make them easier to read
    (see the <a href="command_ref.html#fcm_config">FCM Command Reference</a>
    section for further details about configuration files).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Probably the best advice is to look at what has already been set up for
  other systems. The FCM team can advise on the best systems to examine.</p>

  <p>When you create a stable build you should keep an extract configuration
  file that can reproduce the build. One easy way to do this is to create your
  build using the standard configuration files and the latest versions of the
  code. You can then save the expanded extract configuration file which is
  created when you run the extract. To help document your stable build you can
  use the command <code>fcm cmp-ext-cfg</code> to show what has changed.</p>

  <h2 id="alternate_versions">Maintaining alternate versions of namelists and
  data files</h2>

  <p>Sometimes it is useful to be able to access particular revisions of some
  directories from a FCM repository without having to go via Subversion.
  Typical examples are namelist or data files used as inputs to a program. The
  script <code>fcm_update_version_dir.pl</code> is designed to help with this.
  It can be used to maintain a set of extracted version directories from a FCM
  repository. The script has the following options and arguments:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>-f [--full]</code></dt>

    <dd>Specify the full mode, in which the versioned directories of each
    specified item will be removed before being re-extracted.</dd>

    <dt><code>-d [--dest] arg</code></dt>

    <dd>Specify a destination <var>arg</var> for the extraction. If not
    specified, the current working directory will be used as the base
    path.</dd>

    <dt><code>-u [--url] arg</code></dt>

    <dd>Specify the source repository URL. This option is compulsory.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>If an argument is specified, it must be the location of a configuration
  file. Otherwise, the command reads its configuration from the standard input.
  The configuration file is a line-based text file. Blank lines and lines
  beginning with a <samp>#</samp> are ignored.</p>

  <p>Each configuration line must contain the relative path of a sub-directory
  under the specified source repository URL. If the path ends in <samp>*</samp>
  then the path is expanded recursively and any sub-directories containing
  regular files are added to the list of relative paths to extract.</p>

  <p>Optionally, each relative path may be followed by a list of space
  separated conditions. Each condition is a conditional operator
  (<code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>,
  <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code>) followed by a
  revision number or the keyword HEAD.</p>

  <p>The command uses the revision log to determine the revisions at which the
  relative path has been updated in the source repository URL. If these
  revisions also satisfy the conditions set by the user, they will be
  considered in the extraction. In full mode, everything is re-extracted. In
  incremental mode, the version directories are only updated if they do not
  already exist.</p>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm_update_version_dir.pl -u fcm:ver_tr &lt;&lt;EOF
namelists/VerNL_AreaDefinition   &gt;1000 !=1234
namelists/VerNL_GRIBToPPCode     &gt;=600 &lt;3000
namelists/VerNL_StationList      
elements/*                       &gt;1000
EOF
</pre>

  <p>N.B.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Each time a sub-directory is revised, the script assigns a sequential
    <em>v</em> number for the item. Each <em>v</em> number for a sub-directory,
    therefore, is associated with a revision number. For each extracted
    revision directory, there is a corresponding <em>v</em> number symbolic
    link pointing to it.</li>

    <li>The system also creates a symbolic link <samp>latest</samp> to point to
    the latest extracted revision directory.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="work-practise">Defining working practises and policies</h2>

  <p>Some options on working practises and policies are defined in the chapter
  on <a href="working_practices.html">Code Management Working Practices</a>.
  Individual projects should document the approach they have adopted. In
  addition, each project may also need to define its own working practices and
  policies to suit its local need. For example each project may need to
  specify:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Whether changes are allowed directly on the trunk or whether branches
    have to be used in all cases.</li>

    <li>Whether all users are allowed to make changes to the trunk.</li>

    <li>Whether Trac tickets have to be raised for all changes to the
    trunk.</li>

    <li>Whether Trac tickets should be raised for all support queries or
    whether a Trac ticket should only be raised once there is an agreed
    "issue".</li>

    <li>Whether branches should normally be made from the latest code or from a
    stable release.</li>

    <li>Whether a user is allowed to resolve conflicts directly when merging a
    branch into the trunk or whether he/she should merge the trunk into the
    branch and resolve the conflicts in the branch first.</li>

    <li>Whether all code changes to the trunk need to be reviewed.</li>
