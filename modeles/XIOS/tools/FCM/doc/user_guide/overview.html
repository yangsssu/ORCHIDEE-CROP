  <h1>System Overview</h1>

  <p>The FCM system is designed to simplify the task of managing and building
  source code. It consists of three main components.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Code Management (CM) System</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>This system provides facilities for making changes to source code in a
      controlled and straightforward manner.</p>

      <p>Version control is provided by the open source tool <a href=
      "http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>. The source code and its
      history are stored in a central database which is called the repository.
      Support for parallel working is provided through the use of branches.</p>

      <p>The open source web-based tool <a href=
      "http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> allows changes to be examined and
      documented. It provides an integrated issue tracker, wiki and repository
      browser.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Build System</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>This system allows source code to be compiled with a minimal amount of
      configuration. Compilation time can be minimised through the use of
      pre-compiled code and by using the parallel make facilities provided by
      the open source tool <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/"><em>GNU
      Make</em></a>.</p>

      <p>It provides a number of powerful features aimed primarily at building
      Fortran 9x code.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Extract System</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>This system provides the interface between the CM and build systems.
      Code is extracted and presented in a suitable form for the build system.
      Code can be mirrored to a different build platform if necessary.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The diagram below illustrates how these components fit together.</p>

  <p class="image"><img src="fcm_overview.png" alt="FCM system overview" /></p>

  <p>The following sections discuss these components in more detail.</p>

  <h2>Code Management System</h2>

  <p>The CM system is built using a number of open source tools, in particular
  Subversion and Trac.</p>

  <p>Subversion is a modern version control tool with a large and rapidly
  expanding user base. For a summary of its main features please refer to the
  <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.intro.whatis.html">What is
  Subversion?</a> section in the <a href=
  "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/">Version Control with Subversion</a>
  book.</p>

  <p>Subversion is a generalised tool which can be used in lots of different
  ways. This makes some day-to-day tasks more complex than they need be. FCM
  defines a simplified process and appropriate naming conventions. It then adds
  a layer on top of Subversion to provide a natural interface which is
  specifically tailored to this process. Where appropriate it simply makes use
  of the command line tools provided by Subversion. However, in other cases it
  provides significant additional functionality, for example:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>By making some assumptions about the repository layout (i.e. by
    imposing a standard working practise) FCM simplifies the task of creating
    branches and enforces a standard branch naming convention.</li>

    <li>Having defined working practises and standard log messages allows FCM
    to greatly simplify the process of merging changes between branches.</li>

    <li>FCM makes use of <a href="http://furius.ca/xxdiff/">xxdiff</a> (a
    graphical merge tool) to simplify the process of resolving any conflicts
    which result from a merge.</li>

    <li>Code changes can be examined in graphical form using xxdiff FCM also
    allows you to easily examine the changes made on a branch.</li>

    <li>FCM allows you to check where any particular branch has been used and
    which version is being used.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>FCM also provides a simple GUI which allows easy access to most of the
  common commands which you will need.</p>

  <p>Trac is the other main component of the CM system. It is a powerful web
  based tool which helps you to manage your software project. It includes the
  following features:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A flexible issue tracker which can be used to keep track of bugs,
    feature requests, etc. Each issue (known as a <q title=
    "http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracTickets">ticket</q> within Trac) can be
    given a priority and assigned to a particular person. Changes made to your
    Subversion repository can easily be traced to the relevant ticket. Where
    appropriate, tickets can be used to record information about who has
    reviewed each change.</li>

    <li>A <q title="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracRoadmap">roadmap</q>
    feature which helps you to plan and manage project releases. Each ticket
    can be associated with a particular milestone. Trac can then easily show
    you what features or fixes went into a particular release or what work
    remains before a particular milestone is reached.</li>

    <li>A <q title="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracWiki">wiki</q> which can
    be used for project documentation.</li>

    <li>A browser for viewing your Subversion repository which allows you to
    browse the project tree / files and examine revision logs and
    changesets.</li>

    <li>A timeline view which summarises all the activity on a project (changes
    to the tickets, wiki pages or the Subversion repository).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Build System</h2>

  <p>The build system provides the following features:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Automatic generation of Makefile's at build time based on a simple
    configuration file.</li>

    <li>Full dependency analysis at build time.</li>

    <li>Automatic generation of Fortran 9X interface files at build time.</li>

    <li>Support for non-standard source code. You can override automatic
    dependency and compile rules in order to deal with code which does not
    conform to the necessary coding standards.</li>

    <li>Flexible control over compiler flags. Changes to compiler flags trigger
    the appropriate re-compilation.</li>

    <li>Support for Pre-processor directives. Changes to Pre-processor flags
    trigger the appropriate re-compilation.</li>

    <li>Support for pre-compiled object code to speed compilation time.</li>

    <li>GNU <code>make</code> is used to perform the build. Build times on
    multi-processor systems can be reduced by running parallel processes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Extract System</h2>

  <p>The extract system provides the following features:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Extract code to a directory tree suitable for feeding into the build
    system. Code can be combined from multiple repositories and branches. Local
    user code can also be included.</li>

    <li>Either a complete set of source code may be extracted or just a set of
    changes relative to pre-compiled code.</li>

    <li>A simple configuration file defines what code is required (and what
    compile options are required). Typically, standard versions of these
    configuration files are maintained within the repository. Users can then
    define changes relative to these standard versions.</li>

    <li>If necessary, code can be transferred to a different platform ready for
    building.</li>
  </ul>
