  <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>

  <p>Fortran is the standard programming language at the Met Office for
  developing scientific and research applications, in particular, for programs
  running on the supercomputers. This document describes some guidelines that
  should be followed by developers when writing Fortran code, especially for
  code in systems hosted by FCM.</p>

  <h2 id="fcm">2. Programming Fortran for the FCM build system</h2>

  <h3 id="fcm-general">2.1 General</h3>

  <p>To get the most out of the FCM build system, you should follow these
  guidelines when you develop your code:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Each source file should contain one and no more than one top level
    program unit, (such as a <code>PROGRAM</code>, a standalone
    <code>SUBROUTINE</code>/<code>FUNCTION</code> or a <code>MODULE</code>).
    All top level standalone program units in a source tree should be uniquely
    named. ( <dfn>Top level</dfn> means a standalone program unit that is
    compilable independently, i.e. this rule does not restrict the naming and
    placements of sub-programs in a <code>CONTAINS</code> section.) FCM may
    fail to set up the dependency tree of your source correctly if you do not
    follow this rule.

      <p>A clash of program unit names happens most often when you have
      multiple versions of the same program unit in the same source tree. You
      should design your code to avoid this situation. If it is not possible to
      do so, you may have to use a pre-processor to ensure that there is only
      one copy of each program unit in the source tree. Another situation where
      clashes of program unit names may occur is when you are developing code
      that is shared between several projects. In this case, you may want to
      agree with the other projects a naming convention to define a unique
      namespace for program units in each project. (E.g. some projects at the
      Met Office have adopted a naming convention such that all shared program
      units in a project are named with a unique prefix.)</p>
    </li>

    <li>All code should be written using the free source form. (At Fortran 95,
    the free source form can have a maximum of 132 characters per line, and up
    to 39 continuations in a Fortran statement.) The fixed source form is
    obsolete, and is not supported by the interface file generators used by
    FCM.</li>

    <li>An interface should be provided when calling a <code>SUBROUTINE</code>
    or a <code>FUNCTION</code>. Not only is this considered good practice, it
    also allows FCM to determine the dependency relationship of your source
    files. An interface can be provided in these ways:

      <dl>
        <dt>Internal sub-program</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Place sub-programs in the <code>CONTAINS</code> section of a
          standalone program unit. There are two advantages for this approach.
          Firstly, the sub-programs will get an automatic interface when the
          container program unit is compiled. Secondly, it should be easier for
          the compiler to provide optimisation when the sub-programs are
          internal to the caller. The disadvantage of this approach is that the
          sub-programs are local to the caller, and so they cannot be called by
          other program units. Therefore, this approach is only suitable for
          small sub-programs local to a particular program unit.</p>

          <p>Note: One way to share a sub-program unit between several top
          level program units is to make use of the Fortran
          <code>INCLUDE</code> statement. You can write the sub-program unit in
          a separate file and place it in the <code>CONTAINS</code> section of
          different program units using <code>INCLUDE</code> statements. The
          disadvantage of this approach is that when the program is compiled, a
          copy of the sub-program unit will be embedded within each of the top
          level program units. This may lead to an increase in size of the
          executable, and so this approach is still only suitable for small
          sub-programs local to a small number of program units.</p>

          <p>For example, if we have a <code>SUBROUTINE</code> in
          <samp>sub_prog.inc</samp>:</p>
        </dd>

        <dd>
          <pre>
SUBROUTINE sub_prog(some, arg)
! Some declarations ...
! Some executable statements ...
END SUBROUTINE sub_prog
</pre>

          <p>It can be placed in a <code>MODULE</code> in
          <samp>bar.f90</samp>:</p>
        </dd>

        <dd>
          <pre>
SUBROUTINE bar(more, arg)
! Some declarations ...
! Some executable statements ...
CALL sub_prog(some, arg)
! More executable statements ...
CONTAINS
  INCLUDE 'sub_prog.inc'
END SUBROUTINE bar
</pre>
        </dd>

        <dt>Module procedures</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Place sub-programs in the <code>CONTAINS</code> section of a
          <code>MODULE</code>. Again, the sub-programs will have automatic
          interfaces when the <code>MODULE</code> is compiled. If you give the
          sub-programs the PUBLIC attribute (which is the default), you will be
          able to call them from anywhere using the current
          <code>MODULE</code>. You will also gain all the advantages offered by
          a <code>MODULE</code>. (E.g. a <code>MODULE</code> will allow you to
          design your code in a more object-oriented manner.) However,
          <code>MODULE</code> dependency can have an impact on the efficiency
          of incremental compilations. For example, if you modify items that
          are local to the <code>MODULE</code>, it is very difficult for the
          build system to detect that your change does not affect program units
          using the <code>MODULE</code>, so the build system will end up
          compiling the <code>MODULE</code> and all the program units that use
          it.</p>

          <p>For example, if we have a <code>MODULE</code> in
          <samp>my_mod.f90</samp>:</p>
          <pre>
MODULE my_mod
! Some module declarations
CONTAINS
  SUBROUTINE sub_prog(some, arg)
  ! Some declarations ...
  ! Some executable statements ...
  END SUBROUTINE sub_prog
END MODULE my_mod
</pre>

          <p>It can be imported to another program as such:</p>
          <pre>
SUBROUTINE foo(some, arg)
USE my_mod, ONLY: sub_prog
! Some declarations ...
! Some executable statements ...
CALL sub_prog(some, arg)
! More executable statements ...
END SUBROUTINE foo
</pre>
        </dd>

        <dt>Interface files</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>For each source file containing a standalone
          <code>SUBROUTINE</code> or <code>FUNCTION</code>, FCM generates a
          file containing the interface of the <code>SUBROUTINE</code> or
          <code>FUNCTION</code>. By default, the generated file is named after
          the original source file, but with the file extension replaced by
          <samp>*.interface</samp>. In the specification section of the caller
          routine, you will then be able to declare the interface using a
          Fortran <code>INCLUDE</code> statement to include the interface file.
          This type of <code>INCLUDE</code> statement is detected automatically
          by FCM, which will use it to set up the dependency tree.</p>

          <p>The advantage of using an interface file is that the caller is now
          dependent on the interface file, rather than the
          <code>SUBROUTINE</code> or <code>FUNCTION</code> itself. If you
          change the <code>SUBROUTINE</code> or <code>FUNCTION</code> without
          modifying its interface, the build system will not re-compile the
          caller in incremental build, (but it will be intelligent enough to
          re-link the executable with the updated object).</p>

          <p>Note: By default, an interface file is named after the original
          source file. Bearing this in mind, it is worth noting that file names
          in a Unix/Linux system are case-sensitive, and so the interface file
          name declared by your <code>INCLUDE</code> statement is also case
          sensitive. If you use an incorrect case in the <code>INCLUDE</code>
          statement, the dependency tree will be set up incorrectly and the
          compilation will fail. Another problem is that if you do not name
          your file after the program unit, the dependency tree will be wrong.
          To avoid this problem, it is recommended that all source files are
          named in lower case after the program units they contain.
          (Alternatively, you can use the <code>TOOL::INTERFACE</code> option
          in the FCM build configuration file to allow you to alter the default
          behaviour so that the interface file is named after the program unit
          in lowercase. We may alter FCM in the future so that this will become
          the default. In the mean time, it is highly recommended that you use
          this option and design your new code accordingly.)</p>

          <p>For example, if we have a <code>SUBROUTINE</code> in
          <samp>sub_prog.f90</samp>:</p>
          <pre>
SUBROUTINE sub_prog(some, arg)
! Some declarations ...
! Some executable statements ...
END SUBROUTINE sub_prog
</pre>

          <p>It can be imported to another program as such:</p>
          <pre>
SUBROUTINE egg(some, arg)
! Some declarations ...
INCLUDE 'sub_prog.interface'
! More declarations ...
! Some executable statements ...
CALL sub_prog(some, arg)
! More executable statements ...
END SUBROUTINE egg
</pre>
        </dd>

        <dt>Interfaces in a module</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>There is also a half-way house approach between the second and the
          third options. You can have a dedicated <code>MODULE</code> where a
          large number of <code>INCLUDE</code> interface file statements are
          placed. Other program units get their interfaces by importing from
          this <code>MODULE</code>. A major disadvantage of this approach is
          that the sub-programs with their interfaces declared within this
          <code>MODULE</code> will not be able to call any other sub-programs
          declared within the same <code>MODULE</code>, as it will run into a
          cyclic dependency problem. Another disadvantage is that if an
          interface changes, the <code>MODULE</code> and all program units
          depending on the <code>MODULE</code> will have to be re-compiled,
          even though the change may be unrelated to some or all of these
          program units. For these reasons, this approach is only good if you
          have a bundle of sub-programs that have relatively stable interfaces
          and are very much independent of one another.</p>

          <p>Note: a similar approach can be useful when you have a library of
          legacy or external code. In this situation, you will simply declare
          the interfaces for all the library sub-programs in the
          <code>MODULE</code>. Any programs that call sub-programs within the
          library can then import their interfaces by using the
          <code>MODULE</code>.</p>

          <p>For example, if we have a <samp>MODULE my_i_mod</samp>:</p>
          <pre>
MODULE my_i_mod
! Some declarations
INCLUDE 'sub_prog.interface'
! More declarations
END MODULE my_i_mod
</pre>

          <p>Its <code>PUBLIC</code> procedures can be imported as such:</p>
          <pre>
SUBROUTINE ham(some, arguments)
USE my_i_mod, ONLY: sub_prog
! Some declarations ...
! Some executable statements ...
CALL sub_prog(some, arguments)
! More executable statements ...
END SUBROUTINE ham
</pre>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>FCM also supports the use of a <code>! DEPENDS ON</code> directive for
      users to specify a dependency from within a source file. This feature is
      documented in the <a href=
      "../user_guide/build.html#advanced_dependency">Further dependency
      features</a> sub-section of the <a href="../user_guide/">FCM user
      guide</a>. However, it is worth noting that this method is only included
      in FCM to support legacy code. It is not a feature recommended for new
      code, and its use should be gradually phased out from existing code.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Arguments and local variables should be declared in different
    statements. It makes your declaration clearer, and it is friendlier to the
    interface file generator.

      <dl>
        <dt>Common practice</dt>

        <dd>
          <pre>
SUBROUTINE foo(a, b, c)
INTEGER :: a, b, c, i, j, k
! ...
END SUBROUTINE foo
</pre>
        </dd>

        <dt>Better approach</dt>

        <dd>
          <pre>
SUBROUTINE foo(a, b, c)
INTEGER :: a, b, c
INTEGER :: i, j, k
! ...
END SUBROUTINE foo
</pre>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </li>

    <li>Use the <code>ONLY</code> clause in a <code>USE &lt;module&gt;</code>
    statement to declare all imported symbols (i.e. parameters, variables,
    functions, subroutines, etc). This makes it easier to locate the source of
    each symbol, and avoids unintentional access to other <code>PUBLIC</code>
    symbols within the <code>MODULE</code>. It is also friendlier to the
    compiler and the interface file generator, as they will not have to import
    modules and symbols that are unnecessary.</li>

    <li>In its default settings, FCM recognises the following file extensions
    as Fortran free format source files:

      <ul>
        <li><samp>*.f90, *.f95</samp>: regular Fortran free format source
        files</li>

        <li><samp>*.F90, *.F95</samp>: Fortran free format source files that
        require pre-processing</li>

        <li><samp>*.inc</samp>: Include files that can be added to a regular
        Fortran free format source file with a Fortran <code>INCLUDE</code>
        statement</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="fcm-cpp">2.2 Use of C pre-processor with Fortran</h3>

  <p>We do not recommend the use of C pre-processor with Fortran. However, it
  is acknowledged that there are some situations when it is necessary to
  pre-process Fortran code. FCM supports pre-processing in two ways.
  Pre-processing can be left to the compiler or it can be done in a separate
  early stage of the build process. A separate pre-process stage can be useful
  if pre-processing changes any of the following in a program unit:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>its name</li>

    <li>its calling interface</li>

    <li>its dependencies</li>
  </ul>

  <p>However, using a separate pre-process stage is not the best way of
  working, as it adds an overhead to the build process. If your code requires
  pre-processing, you should try to design it to avoid changes in the
  above.</p>

  <p>In practice, the only reasonable use of C pre-processor with Fortran is
  for code selection. For example, pre-processing is useful for isolating
  machine specific libraries or instructions, where it may be appropriate to
  use inline alternatives for small sections of code. Another example is when
  multiple versions of the same procedure exist in the source tree and you need
  to use the pre-processor to select the correct version for your build.</p>

  <p>Avoid using the C pre-processor for code inclusion, as you should be able
  to do the same via the Fortran <code>INCLUDE</code> statement. You should
  also avoid embedding pre-processor macros within the continuations of a
  Fortran statement, as it can make your code very confusing.</p>

  <h2 id="fortran">3. Programming Fortran in general</h2>

  <p>The guidelines in this section are recommended practices for programming
  Fortran in general. These are guidelines you should try to adhere to when you
  are developing new code. If you are modifying existing code, you should
  adhere to its existing standard and style where possible. If you want to
  change its standard and style, you should seek prior agreements with the
  owner and the usual developers of the code. Where possible, you should try to
  maintain the same layout and style within a source file, and preferably,
  within all the source code in a particular project.</p>

  <p>When reading these guidelines, it is assumed that you already have a good
  understanding of modern Fortran terminology. It is understood that these
  guidelines may not cover every aspect of your work. In such cases, you will
  be a winner if you use a bit of common sense, and always bearing in mind that
  some other people may have to maintain the code in the future.</p>

  <p>Always test your code before releasing it. Do not ignore compiler
  warnings, as they may point you to potential problems.</p>

  <h3 id="fortran-layout">3.1 Layout and formatting</h3>

  <p>The following is a list of recommended practices for layout and formatting
  when you write code in Fortran.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Indent blocks with space characters. The use of 2 spaces per
    indentation level is wide spread at the Met Office. The use of 4 spaces per
    indentation level is most popular in the open source community because it
    is easier for the human eyes. If you are modifying existing scripts, you
    should stick to their existing styles. Otherwise, the use of 2 and 4 spaces
    per indentation level are both acceptable, as long as it is consistent
    within a source file. Where possible, comments should be indented with the
    code within a block.</li>

    <li>Use space and blank lines where appropriate to format your code to
    improve readability. (Use genuine spaces but avoid using tabs, as the <kbd>
      tab</kbd> character is not in the Fortran character set.) In the
      following example, the code on the right hand side is preferred:

      <dl>
        <dt>Common practice</dt>

        <dd>
          <pre>
DO i=1,n
  a(i)%c=10*i/n
  b(i)%d=20+i
ENDDO
IF(this==that)THEN
  distance=0
  time=0
ENDIF
</pre>
        </dd>

        <dt>Better approach</dt>

        <dd>
          <pre>
DO i = 1, n
  a(i)%c = 10 * i / n
  b(i)%d = 20 + i
END DO

IF (this == that) THEN
  distance = 0
  time     = 0
END IF
</pre>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </li>

    <li>Try to confine your line width to 80 characters, so that your code can
    be printed easily on A4 paper.</li>

    <li>Line up your statements, where appropriate, to improve readability. For
    example:

      <dl>
        <dt>Common practice</dt>

        <dd>
          <pre>
REAL, INTENT(OUT) :: my_out(:)
REAL, INTENT(INOUT) :: my_inout(:)
REAL, INTENT(IN) :: my_in(:)
! ...
CHARACTER(LEN=256) :: my_char
! ...
my_char = 'This is a very very very very very very very very very very ' // &amp;
   'very very very very very very very very very very very very ' // &amp;
   'long character assignment'
</pre>
        </dd>

        <dt>Better approach</dt>

        <dd>
          <pre>
REAL, INTENT(  OUT) ::   my_out(:)
REAL, INTENT(INOUT) :: my_inout(:)
REAL, INTENT(IN   ) ::    my_in(:)
! ...
CHARACTER(LEN=256) :: my_char
! ...
my_char                                                                &amp;
    =  'This is a very very very very very very very very very very '  &amp;
    // 'very very very very very very very very very very very very '  &amp;
    // 'long character assignment'
</pre>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </li>

    <li>Short and simple Fortran statements are easier to read and understand
    than long and complex ones. Where possible, avoid using continuation lines
    in a statement.</li>

    <li>Avoid putting multiple statements on the same line. It is not good for
    readability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="fortran-style">3.2 Style</h3>

  <p>The following is a list of recommended styles when you write code in
  Fortran.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>New code should be written using Fortran 95 syntax. Avoid unportable
    vendor/compiler extensions. Avoid Fortran 2003 features for the moment, as
    they will not become widely available in the near future. (Having said
    that, there is no harm in designing your code with the future in mind. For
    example, if there is a feature that is not in Fortran 95 and you know that
    it is in Fortran 2003, you may want to write your Fortran 95 code to make
    it easier for the future upgrade.)</li>

    <li>Write your program in UK English, unless you have a very good reason
    for not doing so. Write your comments in simple UK English and name your
    program units and variables based on sensible UK English words, bearing in
    mind that your code may be read by people who are not proficient English
    speakers.</li>

    <li>When naming your variables and program units, always bear in mind that
    Fortran is a case-insensitive language. (E.g. <var>EditOrExit</var> is the
    same as <var>EditorExit</var>.)</li>

    <li>Use only characters in the Fortran character set. In particular, accent
    characters and tabs are not allowed in code, although they are usually OK
    in comments. If your editor inserts tabs automatically, you should
    configure it to switch off the functionality when you are editing Fortran
    source files.</li>

    <li>Although Fortran has no reserved keywords, you should avoid naming your
    program units and variables with names that match an intrinsic
    <code>FUNCTION</code> or <code>SUBROUTINE</code>. Similarly, you should
    avoid naming your program units and variables with names that match a
    <em>keyword</em> in a Fortran statement.</li>

    <li>Be generous with comments, but avoid repeating the Fortran logic in
    words. State the reason for doing something instead.</li>

    <li>To improve readability, write your program in mainly lower case
    characters. Writing a program in mainly lower case also means that you will
    not have to use the <kbd>Shift/Caps Lock</kbd> keys often, hence, improving
    your code's accessibility. There is a lot of debate on using upper/lower
    cases in a case insensitive language such as Fortran. There is no right or
    wrong, but people have adopted the different approaches over time, each has
    its own merit. If you are starting a new project, you should choose a
    suitable option and stick to it. Otherwise, you should stick with the style
    in the existing code. Some options are listed here:

      <ul>
        <li>The ALL CAPS Fortran keywords approach, like most of the examples
        in this document, where all Fortran keywords and intrinsic procedures
        are written in ALL CAPS. This approach has the advantage that Fortran
        keywords stand out, but it does increase how often the Shift/Caps Lock
        key is used. Programmers who are used to some other programming
        languages may also find it difficult to read a program with a lot of
        upper case characters.</li>

        <li>The Title Case Fortran keywords approach, where all Fortran
        keywords are written with an initial capital case letter.</li>

        <li>The sentence case approach, where only the initial character in a
        Fortran statements is written in capital case letter, like a normal
        sentence.</li>

        <li>The all lower case approach, where all Fortran keywords are written
        in lower case letters.</li>

        <li>Some people have also proposed a variable naming convention where
        local variables start with an initial lower case letter, private module
        level variables with an initial capital case letter and public module
        variables written in all caps. However, this approach has been seen by
        many as too restrictive, and so its use has not been widely
        spread.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Use the new and clearer syntax for <code>LOGICAL</code> comparisons,
    i.e.:

      <ul>
        <li><code>==</code> instead of <code>.EQ.</code></li>

        <li><code>/=</code> instead of <code>.NE.</code></li>

        <li><code>&gt;</code> instead of <code>.GT.</code></li>

        <li><code>&lt;</code> instead of <code>.LT.</code></li>

        <li><code>&gt;=</code> instead of <code>.GE.</code></li>

        <li><code>&lt;=</code> instead of <code>.LE.</code></li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Where appropriate, simplify your <code>LOGICAL</code> assignments, for
    example:

      <dl>
        <dt>Common practice</dt>

        <dd>
          <pre>
IF (my_var == some_value) THEN
  something      = .TRUE.
  something_else = .FALSE.
ELSE
  something      = .FALSE.
  something_else = .TRUE.
END IF
! ...
IF (something .EQV. .TRUE.) THEN
  CALL do_something()
  ! ...
END IF
</pre>
        </dd>

        <dt>Better approach</dt>

        <dd>
          <pre>
something      = (my_var == some_value)
something_else = (my_var /= some_value)
! ...
IF (something) THEN
  CALL do_something()
  ! ...
END IF
</pre>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </li>

    <li>Positive logic is usually easier to understand. When you have an <code>
      IF</code>-<code>ELSE</code>-<code>END IF</code> construct, you should use
      positive logic in the <code>IF</code> test, provided that the positive
      and the negative blocks are about the same size. (However, it may be more
      appropriate to use negative logic if the negative block is significantly
      bigger than the positive block.) For example:

      <dl>
        <dt>Common practice</dt>

        <dd>
          <pre>
IF (my_var != some_value) THEN
  CALL do_this()
ELSE
  CALL do_that()
END IF
</pre>
        </dd>

        <dt>Better approach</dt>

        <dd>
          <pre>
IF (my_var == some_value) THEN
  CALL do_that()
ELSE
  CALL do_this()
END IF
</pre>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </li>

    <li>To improve readability, you should always use the optional space to
    separate the following Fortran keywords:
      <pre>
ELSE IF         END DO          END FORALL      END FUNCTION
END IF          END INTERFACE   END MODULE      END PROGRAM
END SELECT      END SUBROUTINE  END TYPE        END WHERE
SELECT CASE
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>If you have a large or complex code block embedding other code blocks,
    you may consider naming some or all of them to improve readability.</li>

    <li>If you have a large or complex interface block or if you have one or
    more sub-program units in the <code>CONTAINS</code> section, you can
    improve readability by using the full version of the <code>END</code>
    statement (i.e. <code>END SUBROUTINE</code> &lt;name&gt; or <code>END
    FUNCTION</code> &lt;name&gt; instead of just <code>END</code>) at the end
    of each sub-program unit. For readability in general, the full version of
    the <code>END</code> statement is recommended over the simple
    <code>END</code>.</li>

    <li>Where possible, consider using <code>CYCLE</code>, <code>EXIT</code> or
    a <code>WHERE</code>-construct to simplify complicated
    <code>DO</code>-loops.</li>

    <li>When writing a <code>REAL</code> literal with an integer value, put a
    <code>0</code> after the decimal point (i.e. <samp>1.0</samp> as opposed to
    <samp>1.</samp>) to improve readability.</li>

    <li>Where reasonable and sensible to do so, you should try to match the
    names of dummy and actual arguments to a
    <code>SUBROUTINE</code>/<code>FUNCTION</code>.</li>

    <li>In an array assignment, it is recommended that you use array notations
    to improve readability. E.g.:

      <dl>
        <dt>Common practice</dt>

        <dd>
          <pre>
INTEGER :: array1(10, 20), array2(10, 20)
INTEGER :: scalar
! ...
array1 = 1
array2 = array1 * scalar
</pre>
        </dd>

        <dt>Better approach</dt>

        <dd>
          <pre>
INTEGER :: array1(10, 20), array2(10, 20)
INTEGER :: scalar
! ...
array1(:, :) = 1
array2(:, :) = array1(:, :) * scalar
</pre>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </li>

    <li>Where appropriate, use parentheses to improve readability. E.g.:
    <code>a = (b * i) + (c / n)</code> is easier to read than <code>a = b * i +
    c / n</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="fortran-feature">3.3 Fortran features</h3>

  <p>The following is a list of Fortran features that you should use or
  avoid.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Use <code>IMPLICIT NONE</code> in all program units. It means that you
    have declare all your variables explicitly. This helps to reduce bugs in
    your program that will otherwise be difficult to track.</li>

    <li>Design your derived data types carefully and use them to group related
    variables. Appropriate use of derived data types will allow you to design
    modules and procedures with simpler and cleaner interfaces.</li>

    <li>Where possible, module variables and procedures should be declared
    <code>PRIVATE</code>. This avoids unnecessary export of symbols, promotes
    data hiding and may also help the compiler to optimise the code.</li>

    <li>When you are passing an array argument to a
    <code>SUBROUTINE</code>/<code>FUNCTION</code>, and the
    <code>SUBROUTINE</code>/<code>FUNCTION</code> does not change the
    <code>SIZE</code>/<code>DIMENSION</code> of the array, you should pass it
    as an assumed shape array. Memory management of such an array is
    automatically handled by the <code>SUBROUTINE</code>/<code>FUNCTION</code>,
    and you do not have to worry about having to <code>ALLOCATE</code> or
    <code>DEALLOCATE</code> your array. It also helps the compiler to optimise
    the code.</li>

    <li>Use an array <code>POINTER</code> when you are passing an array
    argument to a <code>SUBROUTINE</code>, and the <code>SUBROUTINE</code> has
    to alter the <code>SIZE</code>/<code>DIMENSION</code> of the array. You
    should also use an array <code>POINTER</code> when you need a dynamic array
    in a component of a derived data type. (Note: Fortran 2003 allows passing
    <code>ALLOCATABLE</code> arrays as arguments as well as using
    <code>ALLOCATABLE</code> arrays as components of a derived data type.
    Therefore, the need for using an array <code>POINTER</code> should be
    reduced once Fortran 2003 becomes more widely accepted.)</li>

    <li>Where possible, an <code>ALLOCATE</code> statement for an
    <code>ALLOCATABLE</code> array (or a <code>POINTER</code> used as a dynamic
    array) should be coupled with a <code>DEALLOCATE</code> within the same
    scope. If an <code>ALLOCATABLE</code> array is a <code>PUBLIC</code>
    <code>MODULE</code> variable, it is highly desirable if its memory
    allocation and deallocation are only performed in procedures within the
    <code>MODULE</code> in which it is declared. You may consider writing
    specific <code>SUBROUTINE</code>s within the <code>MODULE</code> to handle
    these memory managements.</li>

    <li>Always define a <code>POINTER</code> before using it. You can define a
    <code>POINTER</code> in its declaration by pointing it to the intrinsic
    function <code>NULL()</code>. Alternatively, you can make sure that your
    <code>POINTER</code> is defined or nullified early on in the program unit.
    Similarly, <code>NULLIFY</code> a <code>POINTER</code> when it is no longer
    in use, either by using the <code>NULLIFY</code> statement or by pointing
    your <code>POINTER</code> to <code>NULL()</code>.</li>

    <li>Avoid the <code>DIMENSION</code> attribute or statement. Declare the
    <code>DIMENSION</code> with the declared variables. E.g.:

      <dl>
        <dt>Common practice</dt>

        <dd>
          <pre>
INTEGER, DIMENSION(10) :: array1
INTEGER                :: array2
DIMENSION              :: array2(20)
</pre>
        </dd>

        <dt>Better approach</dt>

        <dd>
          <pre>
INTEGER :: array1(10), array2(20)
</pre>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </li>

    <li>Avoid <code>COMMON</code> blocks and <code>BLOCK DATA</code> program
    units. Use <code>PUBLIC</code> <code>MODULE</code> variables.</li>

    <li>Avoid the <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> statament. Use a
    <code>POINTER</code> or a derived data type, and the <code>TRANSFER</code>
    intrinsic function to convert between types.</li>

    <li>Avoid the <code>PAUSE</code> statement, as your program will hang in a
    batch environment. If you need to halt your program for interactive use,
    consider using a <code>READ*</code> statement instead.</li>

    <li>Avoid the <code>ENTRY</code> statement. Use a <code>MODULE</code> or
    internal <code>SUBROUTINE</code>.</li>

    <li>Avoid the <code>GOTO</code> statement. The only commonly acceptable
    usage of <code>GOTO</code> is for error trapping. In such case, the jump
    should be to a commented <code>9999 CONTINUE</code> statement near the end
    of the program unit. Typically, you will only find error handlers beyond
    the <code>9999 CONTINUE</code> statement.</li>

    <li>Avoid assigned <code>GOTO</code>, computed <code>GOTO</code>,
    arithmetic <code>IF</code>, etc. Use the appropriate modern constructs such
    as <code>IF</code>, <code>WHERE</code>, <code>SELECT CASE</code>,
    etc..</li>

    <li>Avoid numbered statement labels. <code>DO ... label CONTINUE</code>
    constructs should be replaced by <code>DO ... END DO</code> constructs.
    <code>FORMAT</code> statements should be replaced by format strings. (Tip:
    a format string can be a <code>CHARACTER</code> variable.)</li>

    <li>Avoid the <code>FORALL</code> statement/construct. Despite what it is
    supposed to do, <code>FORALL</code> is often difficult for compilers to
    optimise. (See, for example, <a href=
    "http://www.fortran.bcs.org/2007/jubilee/f50.pdf">Implementing the
    Standards including Fortran 2003</a> by <acronym title=
    "Numerical Algorithms Group">NAG</acronym>.) Stick to the equivalent
    <code>DO</code> construct, <code>WHERE</code> statement/construct or array
    assignments unless there are actual performance benefits using
    <code>FORALL</code> in your code.</li>

    <li>A <code>FUNCTION</code> should be <code>PURE</code>, i.e. it should
    have no side effects (e.g. altering an argument or module variable, or
    performing I/O). If you need to perform a task with side effects, you
    should use a <code>SUBROUTINE</code> instead.</li>

    <li>Avoid using a statement <code>FUNCTION</code>. Use an internal
    <code>FUNCTION</code> instead.</li>

    <li>Avoid <code>RECURSIVE</code> procedures if possible.
    <code>RECURSIVE</code> procedures are usually difficult to understand, and
    are always difficult to optimise in a supercomputer environment.</li>

    <li>Avoid using the specific names of intrinsic procedures. Use the generic
    names of intrinsic procedures where possible.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="template">4. Program templates</h2>

  <p>The following is a basic template for a <code>FUNCTION</code>:</p>
  <pre>
[&lt;type&gt;] FUNCTION &lt;name&gt;(&lt;args, ...&gt;) [RESULT(&lt;result&gt;)]

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! DESCRIPTION
!   &lt;Explain what the function does.&gt;
!
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USE &lt;module&gt;, ONLY : &lt;symbols, ...&gt;

IMPLICIT NONE

! Function arguments:
&lt;arguments with INTENT(IN) ...&gt;

! Function result:
&lt;declare the type returned by the function&gt;

! Local declarations:
&lt;parameters, derived data types, variables, ...&gt;

! INTERFACE blocks

  &lt;sub-programs&gt;
END FUNCTION &lt;name&gt;
</pre>

  <p>The basic templates for other types of program units are similar to that
  of a <code>FUNCTION</code>, with the following exceptions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A <code>PROGRAM</code> does not have arguments, so the arguments list
    in the header and the <cite>Arguments</cite> section in the declaration
    section should be removed. All declarations are local to a
    <code>PROGRAM</code>, so the <cite>Local Declarations</cite> section should
    be replaced by a simple <em>Declarations</em> section.</li>

    <li>A <code>SUBROUTINE</code> may have <code>INTENT(OUT)</code> and
    <code>INTENT(INOUT)</code> arguments.</li>

    <li>A <code>MODULE</code> does not have arguments, so the arguments list in
    the header and the <cite>Arguments</cite> section in the declaration
    section should be removed. Where appropriate, the <cite>Local
    Declarations</cite> section should be replaced by a <em>PUBLIC
    declarations</em> section and a <em>PRIVATE declarations</em> section.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When you are distributing your code, you should include a
  <samp>COPYRIGHT.txt</samp> file at a top level directory in your source tree.
