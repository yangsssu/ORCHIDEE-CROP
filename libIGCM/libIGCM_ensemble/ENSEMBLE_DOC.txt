**********************************
ENSEMBLE JOB CREATION
**********************************

Updates 04/06/2014
------------------
1) Updates of Ensemble DATE:
   Fix minor bug: periodic member names start to 0 as for non-periodic

   Create new files "Qclean.month.ENSNAME.sh" and "Qclean.year.ENSNAME.sh" which allow 
   user to use clean_month and clean_year scripts for all members.
   
   New option "INITFROM_NONPERIODIC" is avalaible in ensemble.card to use different 
   simulations for restart (use INITFROM option for all if it is not fill).
   
2) Updates of Ensemble PERTURB:
   Create new files "Qclean.month.ENSNAME.sh" and "Qclean.year.ENSNAME.sh" which allow 
   user to use clean_month and clean_year scripts for all members.
   
3) Updates for ins_job:
   When a new directory is created from config.card, ensemble.card is copy inside if it 
   exists.
   
   If -e option is used, ins_job also works when a new directory is created. But it is 
   still only consider the ensemble.card present in the directory where the command was
   used (it doesn't look for all ensemble.card present in configuration).
      
   Update variable name for "ensemble.card" from $FileName to $F_CFG_ENS to be coherent 
   with $F_CFG for 'config.card'.
  

Updates 11/04/2014
------------------
1) Updates of libIGCM_ensemble.ksh:
  New function "IGCM_ensemble_Init" to read the "active" parameter for each 
  ensemble type. Ins_job could then call only functions link to active ensemble.
  
  Function "IGCM_ensemble_SetAlpha" fill Alpha and AlphaMonth vectors used to create 
  member name suffix (A,B...). Actually return Alpha= A to Z vector and AlphaMonth=a to l
  but it could be adapted later to return n suffixes (n = members number). 
  
  11/04/2014: QsubXXX.txt file become QsubXXX.sh (seems more coherent to it content).

2) Updates of Ensemble PERTURB
  In "ensemble.card" all parameters are in english, so as comments over each param.
  Read "JobName" in "config.card" directly, so ensemble.card NAME could be different.
  Creation of symbolic link to DRIVER directory for each member (mandatory with IPSLCM5_v5).
  Check if directories for each member exist. If this is the case, there is no modification 
  of it (don't touch config.car and Jobxxx inside). Create it else and add command line to
  Qsub.xxx.txt file.
  
3) Ensemble DATE
  Create automatically a set of experiments with defined length and restart file. The 
  descritpion could be defined in a periodic or non-periodic way (or a mix of both). 
  11/04/2014: Update subdir names as ${ENSNAME}${restartnb}A/ and add "_per" suffix for 
  periodic directories.
    
4) Ensemble PARAMETRIC
  Test active parameter in ins_job and print "not implemented yet".


Usage
-----
First of all you need to add a new section called "Ensemble" in config.card - ignored if 
ins_job script is not using for creating an ensemble - as below:
[Ensemble]
#D- Ensemble run ? 'y' or 'n'
#D- If 'y', fill in ensemble.card !!
EnsembleRun= y
EnsembleName=
EnsembleDate=
EnsembleType=

Note that all empty fields will be filled automatically with the ensemble. All of them 
are only to help you to remind the conditions of the run, they don't change the run of 
the Job.

All parameters for ensemble description are in "ensemble.card" and global template of 
simulations are in the "config.card".

Check that you get COMP, POST, PARAM and DRIVER (for IPSLCM5_v5) directories in experiment
folder.
Once "ensemble.card" and "config.card" are correctly written,  to create an ensemble 
simply type: 

       ins_job -e

This will create all the directories of the ensemble and Qsub.xxx.sh, a shell file 
containing all command to submit all jobs (PeriodNb=60 for all simulations).

The Qclean.month/year.xxx.sh are bash files to use clean_month or clean_year script for
all simulations.

NOTE: If a directory exists, ins_job won't modify it. If only some directories of 
the ensemble are presents, it will create the missing one and complete Qsub.xxx.sh 
shell file.

NOTE: If you put ensemble.card and config.card directly in [...]/modipsl/config/IPSLCM5_v5
folder, it will create a new directory from config.card "JobName" value. Then copy the 2 
card files and generate the ensemble structure.

Configuration
-------------

1) Peturb ensembles
   To be done by S. Nguyen.

2) Date restart ensembles
   
   In ensemble.card all configuration of this ensemble are in [Ens_DATE] section.
   Available options for this section are:
   	   active*: 'y' for using date ensemble, 'n' else.
	   NAME*: name of the ensemble (used to create root directory)
	   LENGTH*: default length of the simulation for non periodic and duration 
	   	   for all periodic
	   INITFROM*: Restart name to find all restart files (also use as prefix for
	   	     all simulations)
	   INITPATH*: Restart global directory  
   
	   BEGIN_INIT(1): start date of the first periodic simulation 
	   END_INIT(1): start date of the last periodic simulation
	   PERIODICITY(1): duration between the start of 2 periodic simulations
	   BEGIN_RESTART(1): date of the first restart file (next files will be 
	   		     determined adding periodicity length conform to 
			     config.card calendar).
	   
	   NONPERIODIC(2): list of start dates for all simulations
	   RESTART_NONPERIODIC(2): list of corresponding restart dates
	   INITFROM_NONPERIODIC(2): simulation name to restart for each simulation. 
	   			    IF empty all simulations will use INITFROM one.
	   LENGTH_NONPERIODIC: lenght of each simulation. IF empty all simulations
	   		       duration will be the default LENGTH option.
	   	   
   All parameters with * must be filled.
   All parameters with (1) must be filled for periodic description are empty else.
   All parameters with (2) must be filled for non periodic description are empty else.
   
   WARNING: For list variables, use space between values (no coma).
   
   ins_job -e will create a "NAME" root ensemble directory containing all periodic and 
   non periodics simulations subdir. Subdir names, such as Jobs, are build by concatening
   <NAME><RESTART_NB>A (ex: ensNino0A, ensNino1A...) for non periodic and add suffix 
   "_per" for periodic (ex: ensNino0A_per). 
   
3) Parametric ensembles
  Not implemented yet.
